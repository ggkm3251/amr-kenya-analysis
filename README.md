# 🦠 AMR Surveillance Dashboard (R Shiny)

This project presents an interactive R Shiny dashboard for exploring **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)** data collected from multiple healthcare facilities across various counties. It allows users to filter and visualize resistance trends by **pathogen**, **antibiotic**, and **county**.

---

## Project Goals

- Enable dynamic exploration of AMR data.
- Visualize patterns of resistance to support public health surveillance.
- Demonstrate use of R, data wrangling, and dashboard development in public health.

## Features

- County-level filtering
- Pathogen-specific resistance summaries
- Interactive bar plots of resistance trends
- Timeline visualization by sample date
- Upload-ready format for dummy or real surveillance datasets

## Tools & Technologies

- **R**
  - `shiny`
  - `tidyverse`
  - `lubridate`
  - `ggplot2`
  - `readr`
- **Data Source**: Dummy AMR dataset generated for demonstration
